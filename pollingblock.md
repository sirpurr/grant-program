# VeChain General Grant Application Template

## Project Overview 

- Project: PollingBlock
- Team Name: Crowd Wisdom Inc. 
- Payment Address: USDT (ERC 20) payment address. We don't accept payments for the program in other currencies at this stage.

> ⚠️ *The combination of your GitHub account submitting the application and the payment address above will be your unique identifier during the program. Please keep them safe.*

### Overview

Please provide the following:
- A brief description of the project. 

PollingBlock records poll data on blockchain for auditability while helping clients identify, engage, and collect intelligence from target audience.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem. 

PollingBlock aspires to be a civic tech which echoes VeChain's emphasis on governance applications.

- If relevant, an indication of how you will integrate tools and features (e.g., Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc) to enhance your project. 

PollingBlock will migrate from Ethereum to VeChainThor for our poll data recordkeeping, use Connex to bridge server-side data and VeChainThor, and issue every platform user a Sync2 wallet.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Ecosystem Fit
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?
Two civic tech initiatives similar to ours are Vocdoni.io (part of Aragon.org) and Pol.is, but what sets us apart is we are not just another poll-creating tool like SurveyMonkey.com. We bring voters to the polls with a social media gamification that enables users to monetize their own data while fully complying with GDPR. YouGov.com also share some similarities as far as the reward system goes but we differ by placing more emphasis on civic usages rather than strictly market surveys. We also champion ideas from RadicalxChange.org and plan to introduce quadratic voting and ranked voting as new features.

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.

Built: Plurality Electoral System on Blockchain, Social Network (user tier, photo upload, comment/like/dislike, tag), Gamification (campaigns)

Future Roadmap: Majoritarian and Quadratic Electoral Systems on Blockchain, Dynamic Rating System on Blockchain, Data Science Label System, NLP, Crypto Asset Exchange, Venue Reservation, Payment Gateway, Market Prediction

### Example Roadmap for a dApp Application

#### Overview

|  | Majoritarian System | Quadratic System | Dynamic Rating System | Reservation System | Payment Gateway | Market Prediction | Total |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Estimated Duration | 30 d | 30 d | 30 d |
| Full-time equivalent (FTE) | 2 | 1 | 3 |

#### Milestone 1 — Smart Contract & Backend

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
|-|-|-|
| 0a.| License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that can interact with the deployed smart contracts and backend service. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests |
| 1 | Smart Contracts | We will develop smart contracts that will...  (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the contracts) |
| 2 | Backend | "We will create a backend service that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the backend)" |

#### Milestone 2  —  Frontend

#### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce and publish at least one article/tutorial (e.g., on Medium). It should explain your work done as part of the grant.

## Future Plans

Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

Vision: To examplify a democratic media that is organized along the democratic lines rather than strictly commercial lines with transparency, inclusiveness, one-person-one-vote as the operational principles. 

Mission:
Digital Democracy
Financial Inclusion
Data Ethics
Gamified Learning
